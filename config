# This file contains the configuration options for ge
# Mandatory items must be set.  The main mandatory option is "username"
# ge will not work without you specifying your ssh server username

# The rest of the items are optional and are explained below.


#  MANDATORY: You must specify your usernames here.  myusername is there only
#  as an example, and will not work for you (unless your username on the server
#  you will log into is coincidentally 'myusername'). Instead of "myusername"
#  please write the username that you will use to log in to the primary server below.
#  For example:  username="hsnow"

#  secondary_username is the username you will use to log into the secondary server
#  specified below.  If the usernames are the same then enter your username twice.

username="username"   
secondary_username="username"

#  ge currently expects that the server you connect to is connected to an
#  NFS or network share where your files will live including .emacs, autosave
#  files, files you will edit in emacs, .bash_history etc.  This is the 
#  case for example on the UNM CS machines.  If you are installing in your
#  home folder in such a directory, then you should leave this next variable
#  as the default.  If you are installing on your Linux/UNIX computer somewhere else
#  or a linux/UNIX computer from which you have to ssh to the server to get
#  to your network share, then change the following variable to false.
#  (Default: true)

install_on_remote_server=true

# OPTIONS

#  The following options are not necessary to change if you plan to use ge
#  on the UNM CS servers.  However, you may wish
#  to change them in order to tailor ge to your liking or use alternate servers.

#  Name of primary server that you will have your screen + emacs session on
#  The default is moons.cs.unm.edu

primary_server="moons.cs.unm.edu"

#  Name of secondary server that you will use if the primary server is down
#  or unreachable.  The default is trucks.cs.unm.edu

secondary_server="trucks.cs.unm.edu"


#  PACKAGE OPTIONS

#  a.) Separate bash history for emacs.  

#  If you want a separate bash history (different from global bash history) for
#  shells opened within emacs this should be set to true, or if you want
#  your entire shell history in emacs, this should be set to false.  The
#  default is true.

separate_bash_history=true

#  b.) Additional saved variables

#  By default ge will save the following emacs variables for you:
#  search-ring, regexp-search-ring, kill-ring, compile-history, 
#  query-replace-defaults, and compile-command.
#  if you want additional variables saved so that if screen + emacs is lost
#  due to reboot, crash etc. the session will resume having preseved them,
#  please include them here as a space separated list.
#  For example, additional_saved_vars="foo bar gah"
#  where foo, bar and gah are emacs variables.  After installing ge
#  you can also add them directly to your .emacs file under
#  (setq savehist-additional-variables ...

additional_saved_vars=""

#  c.) Option not to login automatically using SSH certificates

#  As a convenience, this script sets up automatic login without a password
#  using SSH certificates.   This means that you won't have to enter your 
#  password every time you access your screen + emacs session
#  on a remote server.  To turn this feature off, set the following
#  variable to false (default: true)

autologin=true

#  This is false until you copy over your authorization key

already_installed_key=false
